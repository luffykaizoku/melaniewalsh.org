Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in 20th/21st century American literature at Washington University in St. Louis, and I'm interested in networks, new media, and the digital humanities.

I built this website (using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "yeah Jekyll rules")) so that I could start sharing my projects publicly and, most importantly, learn from people smarter than me. Check out my blog if you'd like to see what I'm working on and nerd along.
