Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in 20th/21st century American literature at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm interested in networks, new media, and the digital humanities. I like big novels, but I also think tweets are beautiful, and I spend a lot of my time thinking about how these things aren't incompatibile.

I built this website (using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "yeah Jekyll rules") and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "also lovely")) so I could start sharing my projects publicly and so I could learn from people smarter than me. Check out my [blog](/blog/) or my [projects](/digitalprojects/) if you'd like to see what I'm working on and nerd along!
