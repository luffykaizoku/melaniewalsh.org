I started this blog largely because I wanted to start sharing some thoughts and updates about my project (tentatively titled) "Tweets of a Native Son," a large-scale computational analysis of tweets that mention "James Baldwin" in relationship to Ferguson and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.

Like many other Americans, I was glued to my Twitter feed in August, 2014 as I watched the protests unfold in Ferguson, MO, just miles away from my home and university in St. Louis. The weeks and months following Michael Brown's shooting revealed a rapidly developing relationship between social media, especially Twitter, and racial justice, as it provided new platfroms for organization, counternarrative, and conversation. As a literary scholar, I was particularly interested in the ways that people were invoking and quoting literature in their tweets about Ferguson and #BlackLivesMatter, particularly when they were invoking and quoting James Baldwin. While preparing to teach _Notes of a Native Son_ to my freshmen writing class the following year, I even found myself tweeting a James Baldwin quote to commemorate Mike Brown's death.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;The past will remain horrible for exactly as long as we refuse to assess it honestly&quot;-James Baldwin <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MikeBrown?src=hash">#MikeBrown</a></p>&mdash; Melanie Walsh (@MellyMeldubs) <a href="https://twitter.com/MellyMeldubs/status/630584263952326656">August 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

What about Baldwin seems to resonate with our particular historical moment and this particular platform? Which of Baldwin’s texts and which kinds of texts—fiction, non-fiction, interviews—are being most frequently cited? What might this tell us about how Baldwin's legacy is being constructed and used by readers? My project seeks to answer these questions by conducting a large-scale computational analysis and close reading of tweets about Ferguson and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.

The project is still very much in-progress, but I'm planning to share the findings, thoughts, and problems that I encounter along the way, and I'd truly love feedback, if you decide to follow along.
